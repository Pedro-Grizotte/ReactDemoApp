# ReactDemoApp (React + TypeScript + Vite)

Hello, my name is Pedro and this is my React Demo App.

This README is a practical guide for inspectors/testers to:
- clone the repository
- update the code (`git pull`)
- install dependencies
- run the project
- open the **network link** on other devices
- test the full flow: **phone login → main search → cards → detail page**

---

## 1) Requirements

Install these tools before starting:

- **Git**
- **Node.js (LTS recommended)**
- **npm** (comes with Node)

Verify versions:

```bash
git --version
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## 2) Clone the Project from GitHub

Open your terminal and run:
- **git clone <https://github.com/Pedro-Grizotte/ReactDemoApp.git>**
Enter the project directory:
- **cd <PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>**

---

## 3) Steps on the Project 

Before running the system, make sure your local copy is up to date:
- **git** pull
Run the following command:
- **npm** install
Start the development server:
- **npm** run dev

After starting, you shoul see something similar to:
**Local**:   http://localhost:8080/
**Network**: http://192.168.x.x:8080/

Try out the Network system from different devices :)
